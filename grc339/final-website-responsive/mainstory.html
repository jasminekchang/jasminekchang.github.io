                                <figcaption>The market for work by women doubled over the past decade. But it’s still less than the total sales for Picasso alone.</figcaption>
                            </figure>
                            <h2>Female Artists Represent Just 2 Percent of the Market. Here’s Why—and How That Can Change</h2>
                    
                                <p>When a female artist made auction history last October, a man nonetheless managed to steal the limelight. Five bidders had vigorously pursued British artist Jenny Saville’s 1992 painting of a fleshy female nude, at Sotheby’s, pushing the price to £9.5 million with fees ($12.5 million) and setting a world record for a living female artist. Yet attention was swiftly diverted when onlookers noticed that the final lot of the evening, Banksy’s Girl With Balloon (2006), had suddenly begun to shred itself. By the following morning, the self-destructing Banksy was international news, while Saville was a historical footnote.</p>

                                <p>With or without fanfare, the sum paid for Propped was still less than 14 percent of the record for a living male artist at auction: $91.1 million for Jeff Koons’s Rabbit (1986), set last May at Christie’s. </p>
                                
                                <p>More than $196.6 billion has been spent on art at auction between 2008 and the first five months of 2019. Of this, work made by women accounts for just $4 billion—around 2 percent. For context, works by Pablo Picasso generated $4.8 billion at auction during the same period, more than the total spent on every single female artist in our data set combined—almost 6,000 women.</p>

                                <p>Artists themselves are painfully aware of these discrepancies. “I know the world is the way it’s shown to be in your numbers,” says photographer Catherine Opie, who is in the top 25 female artists collected by US museums, according to our data. “I have done well in my career but, at the same time, there is no comparison with my male counterparts. The men do so much better than I do because they rule the roost in relationship to capitalism. They are still the default go-to for collecting by museums and the market.” </p>

                                <p>The market for art by women is not only smaller, it is also disproportionately concentrated on a few artists. Just five account for $1.6 billion of the $4 billion total spent on work by women over the past 11.5 years. That 40.7 percent market share was split between, in descending order, Yayoi Kusama, Joan Mitchell, Louise Bourgeois, Georgia O’Keeffe, and Agnes Martin. </p>

                                </figure>
                    
                                <p>Galleries also bear responsibility for correcting these biases. “There is a structural issue in that galleries don’t represent enough women in their programs. You need to educate collectors,” Payot says. “You need to confront them with quality.” </p>
                                
                                <p>We surveyed some of the leading galleries about the number of female artists they represent and the proportion of sales those artists bring in. The figures were significantly ahead of auction results—though not anywhere near parity. </p>
                    
                                <p>At the international galleries Pace and Lisson, female artists and estates bring in a disproportionate amount of revenue: almost a quarter of the artists at Pace are female (21 percent or 19 out of 92, including Agnes Martin—the fifth best performing female artist at auction), but they account for more than a third (39 percent) of overall sales. A fifth of Lisson’s artists are female (20 percent or 13 of 65 artists, including Marina Abramović and Carmen Herrera), and they account for around a third of all sales, the gallery estimates.</p>

                                <p>
                                    Throughout the history of art, women have often been represented as a subject rather than the creative force behind the artwork. However, they have continually played an important role in supporting their male counterparts and helping them to achieve stellar careers.
