                                    Throughout the history of art, women have often been represented as a subject rather than the creative force behind the artwork. 
                                </p>

                                   Are there really more arts women than men? After a few minutes of research, however, it became clear that the overwhelming answer was no.

                                <p>
                                    From Artemisia Gentileschi to Wangechi Mutu, 2019 was a year in which women artists broke through the male canon. In museums across the world, the overwhelming impulse in the 2020s will be increased representation of women.

                                <h3>Why Is Work by Female Artists Still Valued Less Than Work by Male Artists?</h3>
                                <p>
                                    Works by female artists comprise a small share of major permanent collections in the U.S. and Europe, while at auction, women’s artworks sell for a significant discount compared with men’s.
